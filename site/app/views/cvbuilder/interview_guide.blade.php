                        <li>When given the opportunity, ask the interviewer questions because you are also "interviewing" them to see if you are a good fit. (check out CorperLIfe<sup>TM</sup> <a href="http://www.corperlife.com/questions-you-can-ask">questions you can ask interviewers</a>)</li>
                        <li>If you think you will be a good fit for the company, ask this one last question: "Have I said anything in this interview or given you any other reason to doubt that I am a good fit for the role?". This gives you the opportunity to address any doubts the interviewer has.</li>
                        <li>Use examples of how your skills and abilities would fit the job.</li>
                      </ol>
